**Welcome to the Freenove Computer Case Kit for Raspberry Pi**

This product is exclusively designed for the RPi 5, a popular single-board computer (SBC).Follow this tutorial, you caninstall a sleek, multi-functional computer case kit for your Raspberry Pi 5 (RPi 5). 

The RPi 5 delivers highly powerful performance with a CPU frequency of up to 2.4GHz. However, this increased power consumption also leads to significant heat generation. Without an appropriate heatsink, thermal throttling may severely limit the Raspberry Pi 5's performance. Additionally, the removal of the 3.5mm audio jack in the RPi 5 has caused inconvenience for many users.

In this context, our case kit came into being. It not only addresses these issues, but also introduces advanced features.

If you encounter any issues, feel free to contact us for prompt and free technical support.
